Soup:
	merging "+"/"-"/"<"/">" sequences into a soup that has
		- cell deltas relative to the initial head
		- the head delta

Fixed Loop:
	a loop of the type "["soup"]" with the soup having a null head delta
	has nice properties, especially if the cell delta at the head is -1
	and even more if the cell value at the head is known

	loops such as "[-]" or "[->+++<]" can be really optimized

Knowledge:
	Start:
		at the execution start, all cells are 0, and head is index 0
	Right:
		there is always be an endless stream of 0s if we go right enough
		so for example the loop "[>]" always terminates without error
	LoopEnd:
		at the end of a loop, the cell value at the head is 0
	LoopStart:
		at the beginning of a loop body, the cell value at the head is non-zero

Using Knowledge:
	example:
		it would be really really cool to be able to optimize things like
		"[[-]>][<]" into things like "[<] set end of dynamic buffer here+1"
		(but it will probably be really hard to get there)

Idiom-friendly knowledge:
	maybe:
		maybe represent the tape knowledge via things like
		"[0 0 8 {non-zero} 0 (? iterations of [0 {non-zero}]) 0"
		to be able to optimize progras with non-fixed loops
		(which are used in a lot of cool programs!!)
